## Introduction for Jhomogenizer

Homogenization methods produce average values for parameters in differential equations applications. For example, if the
coefficient in an elliptic differential equation varies spatially, using a perturbation method formulas for averaging the
coefficient are produced. Typically, the formulas involve an auxiliary system of differential equations. The auxiliary
system of equations must be solved. Once the solution is available the solution is plugged into an integral average to
produce a single constant value. The literature on homogenization methods is extensive. Since this code repository involves
distribution of codes for approximating the solution of the auxiliary system and computing the constant average, the user
should realize that this site will not provide a thorough discussion of the theoretical results in the literature.
